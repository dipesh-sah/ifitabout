        <h2>About us</h2>

        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>
          If It Barks is a North Carolina based small business offering handmade
          dog collars, leashes and tags that match your dog's specifications and
          style.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our specialty is martingale dog collars for their fit and function,
          but each design is also offered as a side release buckle dog collar,
          with optional coordinating leash options.
        </p>
        <h2>Our history</h2>
        <p>
          If It Barks was founded by Nicole Robbins in 2002 thanks to her dogs,
          Nutmeg and Oswald. They were both retired racing greyhounds. She
          adopted them and soon realized their dog collar needs were unique.
          Because their heads are smaller than their necks, they required a
          martingale type collar.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But why should sighthounds be the only breeds to enjoy the benefits of
          martingales? Instead of making the collars for two dogs, If It Barks
          was started to provide martingale (and eventually side-release) dog
          collars for all types of dogs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Brian and Polly Godwin took over the business in 2015. They are
          excited to continue the mission of If It Barks - providing quality
          products made in the USA that show off the style and fun of owners and
          their dogs.
